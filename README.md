# Welcome to my application based on OLX (Otodom) data! ðŸ‘‹
This is an application built for model training on OLX data for state capital cities of Poland and also for predicting prices of new houses.   
Data come from **KNUM x GOLEM 2022 Hackathon** sponsored by OLX.   

## How to use the application
To run this project you need train7.csv and test7.csv which were too large to put them in this repo. I should have already sent you e-mail with the data or you need to contact me to get it.
You have to put train7.csv in the .../app/backend/data/

You should run this project with Docker.

To run prediction you should use test7.csv. Otherwise you need to put a csv with the exact same columns that use the same encodings etc. as original test7.csv.
To use prediction you first need to train a model in the training page. Then in the prediction page it will predict prices for the city you previously trained the model on.

## API methods 
API has 3 post endpoints.
- "/get_data/" where you should send a dictionary with "city_name" key, where value is name of the city of which you want to get data.

- "/train/" where you should send a dictionary with "city_name" key, where value is name of the city you would like to train the model on.
It returns a dictionary consisting of rmse, mae, data, where rmse is Root Mean Squared Error achieved on validation set, mae is Mean Absolute Error achieved on validation set and data is a dataframe with columns consisting of
actual and pred, where actual is actual prices of houses in validation set and pred is the predicted value.

- "/predict/" where you should send a byte file which is turned into a dataframe used to make predictions for your dataset.

## Here is how the application looks like:
